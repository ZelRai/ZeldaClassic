# Zelda Classic
Zelda Classic is a game and editing tool that lets you create custom Legend of Zelda quests.

Homepage:
[zeldaclassic.com](https://zeldaclassic.com)

The homepage contains information about the latest release, links to the latest binaries, and a repository of custom quests for you to enjoy. 

This repository contains the Zelda Classic source code, for use by the Zelda Classic developers and advanced users wanting to port ZC to new platforms. You do not need to download or compile the source if you want to play Zelda Classic or make quests on Windows, OS X, or (Debian) Linux.

# Note

This repository, dubbed 'Neo ZC' by some, was an experiment due to unforseen circumstances with some previous developers, and was more or less a testing grounds for the 2.55 branch. It is no longer active or maintained but is left up for the benefit of a few forks by community members. There will be a new repository for future versions forthcoming.
